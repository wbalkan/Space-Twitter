# Space Twitter

This is Space Twitter, my DALI developer challenge.

This is a frontend of a social media app known as Space Twitter, which has a few pages with different features:
1. Login/Signup - The login and sign up pages are not connected to a backend, but allow for username and password input.  In particular, the signup page asks for you to confirm your password, and the two password fields must match for the user to continue.
2. Home - This page contains an animated planet and moon, as well as navigation links to all other pages on the site.
3. People - This page lists all users (DALI lab members) and randomly generates 3 of the provided facts about them. Clicking on names redirects to a page showing any members entire profile.
4. Posts - This page contains the sites posts. As there is no backend connected, the initial posts come from a json file, and the user is able to add additional posts.

### `npm start`
To run the app locally, run npm start in the directory containing the git repository.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
